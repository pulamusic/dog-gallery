# a Tachyons flavored page that will feature a randomly shifting gallery of dogs

This should be fun.

Nice. I've got a nice looking page with a header, a photo gallery, and a footer.

* I used Tachyons components to setup the page. I've only needed minor changes so far.
* For now the page has fixed urls for the photos, but that is going to change.
  - [I'm working on a tutorial about using APIs](https://snipcart.com/blog/apis-integration-usage-benefits).
  - In the tutorial he [turns us on to DogAPI](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) that you can call on for random or not-so-random images of dogs.
  - It's a completely open source API, so you don't have to authenticate.
  - This is a fun API project.
* So, in addition to the API calls producing random images in the gallery, I should think of other options
  - some way to modulate and/or randomize the speed at which images change such as hover state
  - add some kind of CSS animation voodoo to the changing of images. Otherwise, it will probably be abrupt
